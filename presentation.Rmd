## My Plot

The following slide presents a plot that makes use of the `Quandl` library
for retrieving US GDP data, and creates a simple plot with that.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(Quandl)
library(plotly)

df <- Quandl("FRED/GDP")
plot_ly(df, x = ~DATE, y = ~VALUE, mode = "scatter")
```

## United States GDP over time

There we go!

```{r}
library(Quandl)
library(plotly)

df <- Quandl("FRED/GDP")
plot_ly(df, x = ~DATE, y = ~VALUE, mode = "scatter")
```
